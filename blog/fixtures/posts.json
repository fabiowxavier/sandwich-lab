It typically includes pork, pâté, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeños, and creamy mayonnaise. Other derivatives swap out cold cuts for different hot proteins: barbecue pork, lemongrass beef, and grilled chicken are all classic options. It's an herbaceous and affordable meal that's accessible to pretty much anyone. There’s even such a thing as dessert bánh mì; instead of the typical savory meat and veggies, you can find bánh mì kẹp kem loaded with ice cream and crushed peanuts. It's okay to eat sandwiches for every meal.</p>",

From there, you can get wild and throw in eggs, potatoes, onion sauce, or even pasta. At some street vendors, it’s a little more DIY -- you go to the bakery, get the baguette, they add the magic, and wrap it in yesterday’s newspaper, giving you both a delicious sandwich AND the satisfying opportunity to finish someone else’s crossword.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Boh loh yau, also known as the humble pineapple bun, is a delectable carb bomb of butter, sugar, and more butter. The Hong Kong breakfast-staple got its name because the sugar cookie-like substance that is placed on the bread dough melts and cracks into a pineapple-like pattern during the baking process (it’s important to note that original pineapple buns don’t contain any actual pineapple). The result is a soft, pillowy bread with a crunchy sugar crust topping, which is delicious in itself. To make the boh loh yau an even bigger treat, the bun is sliced horizontally and a slab of cold butter is placed squarely in its center, making it a remarkably sweet breakfast sandwich of bread and butter.</p>",

            "content": "<p>The Bombay sandwich is essentially India's vegetarian take on a classic club sandwich. Standard fillings like bacon get swapped for raw cucumber and beet slices while lettuce and mayo are traded for a layer of spiced boiled potato and plenty of zingy cilantro chutney. Tomatoes usually make an appearance, so does cheese, but you won't find any chicken or turkey in between the bread layers. And like club sandwiches, there are many variations based on personal preferences. Some make the Bombay sandwich with strips of raw green bell pepper while others add onion or even ketchup. One thing unites all of the sandwiches, however, and that is the fact that they are buttered on the outside and grilled in a sandwich press until the contents are gently warmed up and the exterior is golden brown.</p>",

In Japan, fruit sandos can be found in convenience stores with availability -- and types of sandos -- dependent on the season. What remains a constant is the whipped cream and the fluffy white bread, with crusts trimmed, that encase the juicy produce. Is it dessert? Is it breakfast? It doesn't matter, we're still eating it.</p>",

One of the workers called it 'a Gatsby smash' (the movie version, starring Robert Redford, was playing at the time locally) and all of them lavished the improvised sandwich with praise, so Pandy put it on his menu with the name Gatsby, and it took off.
